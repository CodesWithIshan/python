- **Persistent Storage:** Saves all tasks to a `task.txt` file, so that your data is not lost when you close the program.
- **Smart Deletion:** View all tasks with index number and easily delete any specific task.
- **Error Handling:**
- Prevents crashes from empty input.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if the task file does not exist.
- Validates numeric input for menu selection and deletion.
- **Encoding Support:** Uses `utf-8` to ensure compatibility with different languages ​​and symbols.
